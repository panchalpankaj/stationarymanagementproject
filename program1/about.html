        About The Stationery
    </h1>
     </div>
    <div class="p"><i>Originally, the term 'stationery' referred to all products sold by a stationer, whose name indicated that his book shop was on a fixed spot. This was usually somewhere near a university, and permanent, while medieval trading was mainly carried on by itinerant peddlers (including chapmen, who sold books) and others (such as farmers and craftsmen) at markets and fairs. It was a unique term used between the 13th and 15th centuries in the manuscript culture. Stationers' shops were places where books were bound, copied, and published. These shops often loaned books to nearby-university students for a fee. The books were loaned out in sections, allowing students to study or copy them, and the only way to get the next part of the book was to return the previous section.[2] In some cases, stationers' shops became the preferred choice for scholars to find books, instead of university libraries due to stationers' shops' wider collection of books.[3] The Stationers' Company formerly held a monopoly over the publishing industry in England and was responsible for copyright regulations.</i></p>

Beginning with paper
Nobody knows paper’s exact birthday. There was no birth announcement or press release. PR campaigns weren’t a thing around the year 121 when a man named Cai Lun (Traditional Chinese)is said to have invented paper.

We do know that paper was born in China and is one of the greatest gifts bestowed on humanity. For the first time in history, knowledge could be both stored and transported efficiently.

Paper’s spread throughout the world can be seen as a multiplier of progress. The combination of writing, farming, and paper kickstarted the 2,000 years of progress leading to you reading this today.

Paper changed everything
Proto-paper had been around in various forms for at least 200 years before Cai Lun perfected the recipe. This story may have been retconned, and maybe he just took the credit after the fact, but records do indicate that a man with that name existed around that time and that he was an inventor and politician who served in the court of Eastern Han Emperor He  and then of Empress Deng Sui . Either way, he is said to be responsible for adding essential new materials into the composition of pulp and for standardising how paper was made.


Why was paper such a big deal?
In ancient times (at least in China) records were kept either on bamboo - which was heavy - or on silk - which was expensive. Cai Lun’s paper changed that.

A modern analogy would be the iPhone. Mobile phones, PDAs, and music players all existed and worked but the iPhone combined all of them into one tight package that took advantage of increasing mobile data speeds. Like smartphones today, a few years after Cai Lun’s paper was introduced, it became de rigueur for storing written information.

Eventually, around the year 600, woodblock printing was invented and 150 years after that the first printed newspaper appeared in China. The first newspaper in Europe was published 900 years later, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
